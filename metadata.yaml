description: '"Through his involvement with three women, Theron Ware, a small-town
  Methodist minister, finds that his abstract, absolute notions about himself and
  his world lead to doubt and confusion. Uncertain in his faith, Ware is alone and
  unprepared to meet the moral, scientific, and aesthetic ambiguities of the new [twentieth]
  century."--P. [4] of cover.'
